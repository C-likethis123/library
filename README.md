# library

My attempt at creating a library app as an assignment for the Odin Project.

## Reflections

This assignment aims to help students practice how to use Object Constructors and LocalStorage.
Previously I did not understand prototypes well, but attempting this assignment helped me to understand it better.

All my previous Odin Project submissions were single page apps. This project has two interfaces - a list of books and a form to add a book to the list.

## Further improvements

The project's current state is enough to meet the requirements listed [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library). Nonetheless, there are some things I could improve on:

- Better UI: Adding background colours, styling buttons, forms, and the footer
- Better code structure: decouple UI elements rendering with underlying logic
- Table pagination: show a maximum of 10 items, before clicking on a button to learn more
- Sorting and filtering: allow sorting via number of pages/names, allow filtering based on book title and author
- Allowing users to edit books
